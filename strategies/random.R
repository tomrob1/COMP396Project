# This strategy uses only marker orders

# Every day this strategy trades a random size 
# marketOrder between -maxLots and +maxLots 

# The random numbers are chosen independently 
# for each series (market)

# The strategy makes no attempt to limit itself to the Â£1M budget and so the
# backtester may cancel its orders
